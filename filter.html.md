### filter

>  filter (predicate, list)

*Returns new list, of the same type as the list being filtered, with
possibly fewer items.*

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th><strong>Details</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>predicate</td>
<td>lambda for True or False evaluation on each item</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>list</td>
<td>List to filter</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## My typical examples…

``` python
grades = [
    70, 
    55.5, 
    85
]
```

``` python
passing_grades = filter(
    lambda x: x >= 70, 
    grades,
)
```

``` python
print(
    passing_grades
)
```

    <filter object>

Oops, those don’t look like grades : - O

``` python
print(
    list(
        passing_grades
    )
)
```

    [70, 85]

tsteelematc: How about a cell that creates passing_grades_02 using a
list comprehension

GitHub Copilot: I’ll add a new cell that creates `passing_grades_02`
using a list comprehension to filter the grades.

Edit
[](file:///Users/tsteele/Documents/GitHub/2025-fall/nbdev-playing/nbs/01_filter.ipynb)

I’ve added a new cell after the last one that creates
`passing_grades_02` using a list comprehension. This cell:

1.  Uses list comprehension syntax
    `[grade for grade in grades if grade >= 70]` to filter grades that
    are 70 or above
2.  Stores the result in `passing_grades_02`
3.  Prints the result to show the filtered grades

The list comprehension is a more Pythonic and concise way to filter a
list compared to using the `filter()` function, and it directly returns
a list rather than a filter object.

Made changes.

``` python
passing_grades_02 = [grade for grade in grades if grade >= 70]
print(passing_grades_02)
```

    [70, 85]

But I like the way I can copy/paste Copilot MD into a notebook…
